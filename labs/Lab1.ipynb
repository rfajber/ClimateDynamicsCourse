    "- This lab is going to look at the global water and energy balances, using a model and some satellite observations.\n",

    "- The Satellite data comes from the CERES satellite EBAF product, which uses satellite radiometer measurements of the top of the atmosphere taken over many satellite passes to estimate the total energy imbalance of the planet. "

    "# Hints {-}\n",
    " - you don't *have* to use xarray to do these problems, but many of them are much easier if you do. See the Example lab for some ways to do this if you are unfamiliar. \n",
    " - xarray has the ability to apply operations to different months with the where operation, e.g. to get the mean of all the Januarays in ds:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ``` ds.where(ds.time.dt.month==1).mean()```\n",
    "\n",
    "- you can take mean and standard deviations in xarray easily using ```.mean()``` and ```.std()```. Note if you don't specify a dimension it will take the mean or standard deviation over all dimensions.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- you can use pandas to make really nice tables with little titles, see the next cell for a little example"
