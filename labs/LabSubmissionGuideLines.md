# Lab Submission Guidelines

After some consultation with Dan, here are the new lab submission guidelines 

1. **1 Cell for answers**: After the cell marked questions, there should be 1 markdown cell titled answers, which contains the written part of your answers. Values from calculations or plots may still appear below. 

2. **3 Sentence limit**: The text for each sub question, e.g. Questions 1.1 a) can be no longer than 3 sentences. Do not write a paragraph. 

3. **Penalty for plots not being presentable**: There is an up to 1 mark penalty per question for your plots not being readable. This includes axes being unlabelled, text being unreadable, and the title not being something that can be clearly referenced in the text. 

4. **Include Code Cells**: include all of your code cells in your pdf, this is specifically at Dan's request.
